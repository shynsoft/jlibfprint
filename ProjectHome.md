Jlibfprint offers a basic access to the fingerprint sensors under Linux with Java.

It is essentially a little bridge made through the Java Native Interface to the libfprint C library.

Jlibfprint was developed as part of a small project during our studies at the University of Naples (Universit√† degli studi di Napoli Federico II). It was not developed in the sight to provide a full support to the fingerprint sensors under Linux, but just
as basic access to these peripherals under Java.

We are sharing the code in the hope that it can be enough for your purposes or at least can just be a good starting point to extend the integration of Java with the libfprint library.

This project is fully independent from our university and from the libfprint project. We want thank all the authors of libfprint for their contribution to the open source world on top of which our small software bridge is collocated.
